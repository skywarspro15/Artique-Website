          <h1>AI Character Engine Alpha</h1>
          <p>
            Welcome to the alpha release of our AI Character Engine Demo for
            "Melodies of the Heart"! Immerse yourself in a sneak peek of the
            interactive character experience that awaits in our upcoming game.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p><strong>What To Expect:</strong></p>
          <br />
          <strong>Meet the characters</strong>
          <p>
            Engage in dynamic conversations with two characters from "Melodies
            of the Heart" — Kajiwara Kame and Kishi Shizuka, and a supporting
            Vocaloid character — Hatsune Miku. Each character has a dumbed down
            prompt, preserving the essence of their personalities without
            revealing spoilers.
          </p>
          <br />
          <strong>Converse with emotion</strong>
          <p>
            Chat freely with Kame and Shizuka by simply addressing them. Witness
            their emotions unfold in real-time as they respond to your words,
            showcasing a glimpse of the emotional depth our AI Character Engine,
            powered by ChatGPT, brings to interactive storytelling.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p><strong>API coming soon!</strong></p>
          <p>
            This demo is a preview of the upcoming API release. Experience the
            seamless integration of our Character Engine and get a taste of the
            possibilities for your own projects.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>
          <p>
            Please note that this demo is in its alpha release stage. While we
            strive for a smooth experience, you may encounter it sometimes
            having an identity crisis, straight up refusing to answer, and other
            unexpected behavior. Your valuable feedback will aid us in refining
            and enhancing the engine.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p><strong>Conversations are NOT private</strong></p>
          <p>
            As this is a demo, and is on an alpha stage, we'd like to gain as
            much insight as possible when it comes to troubleshooting problems.
            In this case, your conversation with Kame, Shizuka, or Miku wouldn't
            be private, so please refrain from giving out personal information.
