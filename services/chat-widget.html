          <p>
            Welcome to Personify AI Preview! Immerse yourself in a sneak peek of
            the interactive character experience that's going to be used in our
            upcoming games.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p><strong>What To Expect:</strong></p>
          <br />
          <strong>Meet the characters</strong>
          <p>
            Engage in dynamic conversations with two characters from "Melodies
            of the Heart" — Kajiwara Kame and Kishi Shizuka, and a supporting
            Vocaloid character — Hatsune Miku. Each character has a dumbed down
            prompt, preserving the essence of their personalities without
            revealing spoilers.
          </p>
          <br />
          <strong>Converse with emotion</strong>
          <p>
            Chat freely with Kame, Shizuka and Miku by simply addressing them.
            Witness their emotions unfold in real-time as they respond to your
            words, showcasing a glimpse of the emotional depth our AI Character
            Engine, powered by ChatGPT, brings to interactive storytelling.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>
          <p>
            Please note that this demo is in its alpha release stage. While we
            strive for a smooth experience, you may encounter it sometimes
            having an identity crisis, straight up refusing to answer, and other
            unexpected behavior. Your valuable feedback will aid us in refining
            and enhancing the engine.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p><strong>Conversations are being logged</strong></p>
          <p>
            Conversations you engage with Kame, Shizuka, and Miku would be
            logged in our servers, so that we can gain insight on issues. It's
            also used to help you get back to previous conversations.
